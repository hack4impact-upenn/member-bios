Alex recently graduated with a degree in Networked & Social Systems Engineering and will start working full time at [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/) this fall. While at Penn he was a project manager for CIS350, a Software Design & Engineering course, and technical lead for Hack4Impact. He appreciates that technology can lower the entry barrier to making impactful humanitarian change and when he's not coding he enjoys eating delicious food, [juggling](https://vimeo.com/25578944), and swimming.
