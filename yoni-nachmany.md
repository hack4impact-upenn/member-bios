Yoni is a junior at Penn studying Networked & Social Systems Engineering, a
computer science degree focused on graph theory, game theory, and the Internet.
He is also a leader in the PennQuest outdoor orientation program, guiding 120
incoming freshmen on a hiking and camping trip on the Appalachian Trail.
A former hackNY fellow, Yoni is excited about tech in his native New York City.
Last summer, Yoni worked as a Core Engineer Intern at Meetup: Meetup's mission
is to revitalize local community and help people around the world self-organize.
The summer before, he worked as a Machine Learning Research Intern at Clarifai,
an AI startup developing image recognition technology with deep learning.
In his free time, he enjoys visiting museums on weekends, listening to podcasts
before he goes to bed, and discovering music samples of oldies but goodies.
