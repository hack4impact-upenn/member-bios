Alex is a senior, but is young at heart. He studies computer science, but his interests don't end there. Behind the programmer lies a passionate reader, tennis player, eater, and netflix-er. Alex has worked at Intel, WebMD, NIH/UMBC, and United Rentals. In his limited tenures, he has accelerated Moore's Law, diagnosed every user with cancer, published a paper on not curing diabetes, and driven construction vehicles, respectively.
