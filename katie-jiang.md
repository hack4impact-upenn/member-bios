Katie is a computer science student originally from the SF Bay Area. She did some stuff in the past like CIS 160 TA-ing and whatnot, but doesn't do anything now because she's a senior! She was previously at FB, Airbnb, Opendoor, and is joining [Figma](https://figma.com) full-time after she graduates. Besides being a total weeb, Katie loves sketching, K-pop, board games, and on a more serious note, cares a lot about education and diversity & inclusion. Reach out to her anytime through email and she is happy to help!
