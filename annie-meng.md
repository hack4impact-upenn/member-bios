Annie is a senior in the Digital Media Design program (CS + Art) at Penn but her main interest lies in education technology and reinventing the classroom. Previously she was a research assistant with the Penn Graduate School of Education working on Scratch and was a product engineering intern at Asana. Currently, she's a software engineering intern at Facebook. She's also a proud Canadian, tea and kayaking fanatic, and spent a semester abroad eating large amounts of chocolate while studying Computer Science at ETH Zurich.
