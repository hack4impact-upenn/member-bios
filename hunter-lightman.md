Hunter is a sophomore studying computer science at Penn. Last summer he taught
programming to middle and high schoolers, and this summer he'll be working at
Squarespace. When not teaching, studying, or otherwise hacking
for impact, Hunter enjoys dabbling in hackathons, 3d printing, virtual reality,
and web development. He also likes skiing, watching movies, and ice cream.
