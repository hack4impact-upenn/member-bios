Jediah is a junior studying Computer Science and Math. Outside of Hack4Impact, Jediah is a head TA for CIS 320, Penn's algorithms course, does research on DeepSpec's [Interaction Trees](https://github.com/DeepSpec/InteractionTrees) project, and volunteers for [Moelis Access Science](https://www.nettercenter.upenn.edu/what-we-do/programs/university-assisted-community-schools/moelis-access-science). Jediah is passionate about education and math (don't get him started on that one!), and also a big fan of flags, guitars, and most salty foods.
