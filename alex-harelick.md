Alex recently graduated with a degree in Networked & Social Systems Engineering and will start working full time at [LiveRamp](https://liveramp.com/) this fall. While at Penn he was a project manager for CIS350, a Software Design & Engineering course, and technical lead for Hack4Impact. These experiences made him appreciate technology's ability to lower the entry barrier for making impactful humanitarian change. When he's not coding he enjoys eating delicious food, [juggling](https://vimeo.com/25578944), and swimming.
