Hunter is a sophomore studying computer science at Penn, but right now he's
spending his summer teaching programming to elementary and middle schoolers.
When not teaching, studying, or otherwise hacking for impact, Hunter enjoys
dabbling in hackathons, 3d printing, virtual reality, and web development.
He also likes skiing, watching movies, and ice cream.
