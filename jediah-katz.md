Jediah is a sophomore studying Computer Science and Math. Outside of Hack4Impact, Jediah is a TA for [CIS 160](http://www.thepigeonholeprinciple.com), Penn's intro Discrete Math course, and the Computer Science administrative coordinator for [Moelis Access Science](https://www.nettercenter.upenn.edu/what-we-do/programs/university-assisted-community-schools/moelis-access-science), a volunteer organization that sends Penn students into underresourced high schools in West Philadelphia to teach STEM subjects. Jediah is passionate about education and math (don't get him started on that one!), and also a big fan of flags, guitars, and most salty foods.
