Suzanne is a junior studying [Digital Media Design](http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd_program.html) at the University of Pennsylvania, and is originally from Poughkeepsie, NY. She spent her last summer doing VR eye tracking research at Penn, and is still exploring different areas within computer science and computer graphics. Suzanne is passionate about promoting women in tech, minority rights, and diversity in media (especially children's TV shows and movies!) As an artist, she loves creating and believes in the importance of self-development, and works on independent art/music/video projects whenever she can. In her free and inbetween time, Suzanne likes to listen to [Beach House](https://open.spotify.com/artist/56ZTgzPBDge0OvCGgMO3OY), sketch her friends, and go to the roofs of buildings. 

Outside of Hack4Impact, Suzanne is also a developer for [Penn Labs](http://pennlabs.org/) and a member of the CG community at Penn.
