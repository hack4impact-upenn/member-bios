Hi, I'm Grace! I'm currently a junior at Penn studying computer science and business analytics. I'm excited about anything tech & design related and am currently invested in front-end development. I'm originally from the Bay Area, and I enjoy playing video games & eating good Asian food in my free time. Feel free to say hi!
