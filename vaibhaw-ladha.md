Vaibhaw Ladha is a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Entrepreneurship at the University of Pennsylvania. His interest in engineering and innovation began when he had the opportunity to study abroad in rural China for 6 weeks. He learned about the lack of affordable technologies for the vast majority of the population, and the great potential development could have on everyone's lives. 

Besides Hack4Impact, Vaibhaw is a consultant for the MindBank group, bowler for the club cricket team and a ventures analyst at YouthHack. This past summer he worked at Grab back in his hometown, Bangkok, where he interned as a new products and strategy intern. In his free time, Vaibhaw enjoys the thrill of skiing down slopes, playing basketball with friends and discovering new restaurants!
