Yoni is a junior at Penn studying [Networked & Social Systems Engineering](http://www.nets.upenn.edu/), a
computer science degree focused on networks, crowds, and markets on the Internet.
He is also a leader in the PennQuest outdoor orientation program, guiding 130
incoming students on a hiking and camping trip on the Appalachian Trail,
and is a site leader for Alternate Spring Break this year.
A former [hackNY fellow](https://apply.hackny.org/), Yoni is excited about tech in his native New York City.
This past summer, Yoni was a Core Engineer Intern at [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/), which brings people
together in thousands of cities to do more of what they want to do in life.
The summer before, he worked as a Machine Learning Research Intern at [Clarifai](http://clarifai.com/),
an AI startup developing visual recognition technology with deep learning.
In his free time, he enjoys visiting museums on weekends, listening to podcasts
before he goes to bed, and discovering beautiful music samples every day.
