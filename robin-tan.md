Robin is a junior studying Computer Science and Business Analytics in the M&T program at Penn, originally hailing from Portland, Oregon. He is currently a TA for CIS121, an intro computer science class at Penn, and served previously as a Wharton Analytics Fellow. His goal in Hack4Impact is to transition his energy and background in machine learning research into impactful software engineering solutions for social good. Robin loves making baked goods (banana bread ;-;) with other members of Hack4Impact and spends most of his free time wasting it on TikTok. Robin's greatest accomplishment is sustaining diet of Hot Pockets and instant oats for a month.
