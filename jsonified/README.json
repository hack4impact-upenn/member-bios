    "content": "# Hack4Impact Member Bios\n\nThis repository contains basic information about Hack4Impact members that will\nbe displayed on the [organization website](http://hack4impact.org/team/)\n(or will be soon!).\n\nFeel free to open a pull request to update your information at any time, but\nplease do not commit to `master` or merge the request without approval.\n\n\n## Instructions\n\n### Member Text\n\nCopy the template below into a new file `firstname-lastname.md`. Each member bio\nis a Markdown file with a YAML header marked by `---`. The header contains some\nmetadata, and the document body should contain paragraphs about you.\n\n#### Header fields\n\nTemplate metadata:\n- `layout`: **Don't change this.** This should always have the value `profile`.\n  It's used internally by the site generator ([Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/))\n  to render the Markdown file into a webpage.\n\nBiographical info:\n- `first_name`: Your first name.\n- `last_name`: Your last name.\n- `class_of`: Your (expected) graduating class.\n\nContact information (each of these fields are optional, so only include the ones\nyou want):\n- `email`: An email address that can be used to contact you. Note that this\n  address will be made public, so you may want to set up mail filters or use a\n  different email than your primary one if you choose to include an email.\n- `website`: The _URL_ of your personal website.\n- `github`: Your GitHub _username_ (not URL).\n- `twitter`: Your Twitter _handle_, without the leading `@`.\n- `linkedin`: The _URL_ of your LinkedIn profile (their username conventions are\n  somewhat inconsistent).\n\n#### Exec board members\n\nIn addition to the fields listed above, exec board members should include the\nfollowing (note that `role` is indented):\n\n```markdown\n---\nexec:\n  role: External Relations Chair\n---\n```\n\n#### Alumni\n\nIn addition to the fields listed above, organization alumni should include the\nfollowing:\n\n```markdown\n---\nalum: true\n---\n```\n\n\n#### Template\n\n```markdown\n---\nlayout: profile\n\nfirst_name:\nlast_name:\nclass_of:\n\nemail:\nwebsite:\ngithub:\ntwitter:\nlinkedin:\n---\n\nAdd your bio here.\n\nNote that you _can_ use standard **Markdown** formatting here. Please don't\ninclude any headers or non-paragraph elements, however.\n```\n\n#### Example\n\nHere's an example of the required formatting.\n\n```markdown\n---\nlayout: profile\nfirst_name: Benjamin\nlast_name: Franklin\nclass_of: 1744\nalum: true\n\nemail: benf@seas.upenn.edu\ntwitter: benfranklin\ngithub: bfranklin\nlinkedin: https://linkedin.com/in/benjamin.franklin\n---\n\nBenjamin Franklin was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. A\nrenowned polymath, Franklin was a leading author, printer, political theorist,\npolitician, freemason, postmaster, scientist, inventor, civic activist,\nstatesman, and diplomat. As a scientist, he was a major figure in the American\nEnlightenment and the history of physics for his discoveries and theories\nregarding electricity.\n```\n\n### Member Photo\n\nEach member's photo should be named `firstname-lastname.jpg`. Additionally, each\nphoto should be square and resized to 600 x 600. This can be done on the command\nline using ImageMagick:\n\n```sh\n$ brew install imagemagick\n$ convert <firstname-lastname>.jpg -resize 600x600 <firstname-lastname>.jpg\n```\n",
